  description: I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Minnesota in the Department of Plant Pathology researching plant stress resistance biology. My research interests include using enabling technologies to understand genomic and expression variation within species and associating this variation with precision phenotyping to understand abiotic and biotic stress response in plants.
