  description: I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Minnesota in the Department of Plant Pathology researching plant stress resistance biology. My research interests include using enabling technologies to understand genomic and expression variation within species and associating this variation with precision phenotyping to understand abiotic and biotic stress response in plants.

  description: I am a Master's student in the Department of Plant Pathology. I am developing a diagnostic assay to quantify soil inoculum of Aphanomyces cochlioides, a pathogen of sugar beets. Also, I will be researching genetic diversity between A. cochlioides isolates, and gene expression changes during infection events.
