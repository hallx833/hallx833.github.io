## Graduate Student Opportunities

The Hirsch lab is currently looking for a graduate student to join the lab as part of the [Plant Pathology](https://plpa.cfans.umn.edu/graduate-program/applying) graduate program. Among other projects, the student will research the influence transposable elements might have in creating new regulatory information that can influence gene expression in response to abiotic and biotic stress. This project is unique as it incorporates high-throughput genomic and transcriptomic datasets, along with machine-vision phenotyping. This position has the opportunity to collaborate with other research groups within the Plant Pathology Department, with other departments on campus, as well as outside the University of Minnesota. Prior experience in coding (R, Perl, Python, MATLAB) is desirable. If you are interested in this opportunity please contact Cory Hirsch with a CV and a statement of interest in the position.

## Undergrduate Research Opportunities

The Hirsch lab is always looking for talented undergraduates interested in stress biology and/or coding to join the lab. We use enabling technologies to understand genomic and expression variation within species and associating this variation with precision phenotyping to understand abiotic and biotic stress response in plants. Undergraduates in the lab are encouraged to learn programming, computational biology, genomics, precision phenotyping, and how to manage large data. Please contact Cory Hirsch with a resume and a statement of interest including what you hope to achieve in the experience.
