<div class="about">
  <p>We are located on the St. Paul campus of the University of Minnesota in the Department of Plant Pathology. The interests of the lab include understanding genomic and expression variation within species and associating this variation with precision phenotyping to understand abiotic and biotic stress response in plants. </p>
